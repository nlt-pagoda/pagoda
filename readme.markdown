Fork the project to your account and pull it to your computer.

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**

Before you start to code away don't forget to import our database schema which is under protected/migration/ folder.

Go crazy. 

**Warning**

If for some reason you are getting **CException** error in your Ubuntu/Linux machine then it is probably because the directory runtime/ is not writable. To get around this problem just type 

chmod -R 775 protected/

This should give it write permission
